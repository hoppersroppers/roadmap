If you're not sure if you have enough Linux skils to move on, we came up with a test using OverTheWire Bandit.
You might have heard of this before, it's a big one. If you struggle, go back to the [Linux Training](../training/linux.md). It will make you much better in the long run instead of struggling through this.

This is a classic set of challenges that every member of our team has fought through, and while it takes some time, you should have had enough experience to figure out what you need to do. It won't be easy, and it might not be the most fun, but completion of this challenge is the single greatest determining factor in whether or not you are ready to continue along this journey. 

While there are 25 Bandit levels, at this time we only expect you to be able to complete 1-13. They will be hard, but we know you can do them.

If you have difficulty, go back to the [Linux Training](../training/linux.md). There's no shame in that at all.
